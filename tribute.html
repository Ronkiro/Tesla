            "<b>Nikola Tesla</b> (July 10, 1856 to January 7, 1943) was an <b>engineer</b> known for designing the alternating-current (AC) electric system, which is still the predominant electrical system used across the world today. He also created the <b>"Tesla coil"</b>, which is still used in radio technology. Born in what is now Croatia, Tesla came to the United States in 1884 and briefly worked with Thomas Edison before the two parted ways. He sold several patent rights, including those to his AC machinery, to George Westinghouse."

          <b>There are many mysteries surrounding Tesla's death</b><br>
          <br>
          The recorded cause of Nikola Tesla's death was for Coronary Thrombosis. But there are still many mysteries and speculations about his death. His life is surrounded of mysteries!<br><br>
          "...However, Nikola Tesla’s death was shrouded in mystery and speculation was rife. It was rumoured that Tesla had not died from Coronary Thrombosis but was murdered by one of Hitler’s agents. Three days before Tesla’s death, he was believed to have been seen having a meeting with two of Adolf Hitler’s personal bodyguards including Otto Skorzeny, who is said to be Tesla’s alleged murderer. Otto Skorzeny was also one of Hitler’s spies who infiltrated the U.S Government’s Paperclip Project; a confidential military project for World War 2.

Although Tesla’s autopsy file states Tesla died from Coronary Thrombosis, many of the original papers went missing after his death, before the U.S Government could get their hands on them. Tesla’s inventions would have been a significant threat to the Nazis, and this supports the theory he may have been murdered..."

          "It is paradoxical, yet true, to say, that the more we know, the more ignorant we become in the absolute sense, for it is only through enlightenment that we become conscious of our limitations. Precisely one of the most gratifying results of intellectual evolution is the continuous opening up of new and greater prospects."

          <br>
          "I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything."

          "Our virtues and our failings are inseparable, like force and matter. When they separate, man is no more.

          "Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom."
<br>
          <br>
          "The scientists of today think deeply instead of clearly. One must be sane to think clearly, but one can think deeply and be quite insane."

          "I do not think you can name many great inventions that have been made by married men."
